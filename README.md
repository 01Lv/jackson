## Jackson Project Home @github

This will the portal page for Jackson Project, at github.
It shall contain links to all active Jackson projects owned by Jackson project team;
as well as additional links to external resources.

### NOTE on reporting Bugs

Please **do not** file bugs at this project's issue tracker: bugs should be
report ideally against component they affect.
If you are unsure where that is, the most likely component is `jackson-databind`, so you would use
[Jackson Databind Issue Tracker](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues).

## Actively developed versions

Jackson has two major branches: 1.x is in maintenance mode, and only bug-fix versions are released; 2.x is the actively developed version. Versions use different Java packages and Maven artifact ids, so they are not mutually compatible, but can peacefully co-exist: a project can depend on both Jackson 1.x and 2.x, without conflicts. This is by design.

The latest stable versions from these branches are:

* 2.3.1, released 28-Dec-2013
* 1.9.13, released 14-Jul-2013

Recommended way to use Jackson is via Maven; releases are made to Central Maven Repository.
Individual project pages typically contain download links, leading to CMR.

## Active Jackson projects

Most projects listed below are lead by Jackson development team; but some by
other at-large Jackson community members.
We try to keep versioning of modules compatible to reduce confusion regarding which versions work together.

### Core modules

Core modules are the foundation on which extensions (modules) build upon.
These are three and they are known as:

* [Streaming](../../../jackson-core) ([docs](../../../jackson-core/wiki)) ("jackson-core") defines low-level streaming API, and includes JSON-specific implementations
* [Annotations](../../../jackson-annotations) ([docs](../../../jackson-annotations/wiki)) ("jackson-annotations") contains standard Jackson annotations
* [Databind](../../../jackson-databind) ([docs](../../../jackson-databind/wiki/Documentation)) ("jackson-databind") implements data-binding (and object serialization) support on `streaming` package; it depends both on `streaming` and `annotations` packages

### Third-party datatype modules

These extensions are plug-in Jackson `Module`s (registered with `ObjectMapper.registerModule()`),
and add support for datatypes of various commonly used Java libraries, by adding
serializers and deserializers so that Jackson `databind` package (`ObjectMapper` / `ObjectReader` / `ObjectWriter`) can read and write these types.

* [Guava](../../../jackson-datatype-guava): support for many of [Guava](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) datatypes.
* [Hibernate](../../../jackson-datatype-hibernate): support for Hibernate features (lazy-loading, proxies)
* [HPPC](../../../jackson-datatype-hppc): support for [High-Performance Primitive Containers](http://labs.carrotsearch.com/hppc.html) containers
* [Joda](../../../jackson-datatype-joda): support for types of [Joda](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/) date/time library datatypes
* [org.json](../../../jackson-datatype-json-org): support for "org.json JSON lib" types like `JSONObject`, `JSONArray`
* [JSR-310](../../../jackson-datatype-jsr310): support for "Java 8 Dates" -- experimental, until Java 8 is finalized
* [JSR-353](../../../jackson-datatype-jsr353): support for "Java JSON API" types (specifically, its tree model objects)

### Providers for JAX-RS

[Jackson JAX-RS Providers](../../../jackson-jaxrs-providers) has handlers to add dataformat
support for JAX-RS implementations (like Jersey, RESTeasy, CXF).
Providers implement `MessageBodyReader` and `MessageBodyWriter`.

### Data format modules

Data format modules offer support for data formats other than JSON.
Most of them simply implement `streaming` API abstractions, so that databinding component can be used as is; some offer (and few require) additional `databind` level functionality for handling things like schemas.

Currently following data format modules are fully usable and supported:

* [CSV](../../../jackson-dataformat-csv): supports [Comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format -- `streaming` api, with optional convenience `databind` additions
* [Smile](../../../jackson-dataformat-smile): supports [Smile (binary JSON)](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/SmileFormatSpec) -- 100% API/logical model compatible via `streaming` API, no changes for `databind`
* [XML](../../../jackson-dataformat-xml): supports XML; provides both `streaming` and `databind` implementations. Similar to JAXB' "code-first" mode (no support for "XML Schema first", but can use JAXB beans)
* [YAML](../../../jackson-dataformat-yaml): supports [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml), which being similar to JSON is fully supported with simple `streaming` implementation

In addition, following experimental data formats are available:

* [Avro](../../../jackson-dataformat-avro): supports [Avro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Avro) data format, with `streaming` implementation plus additional `databind`-level support for Avro Schemas
* [CBOR](../../../jackson-dataformat-cbor): supports [CBOR](http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc7049) data format; complete implementation, but not yet extensively deployed.

And in addition there are other data format modules, provided by developers outside Jackson core team:

* [bson4jackson](https://github.com/michel-kraemer/bson4jackson): adds support for [BSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON) data format (by Mongo project). Basic `streaming` implementation (no `databind` changes) -- external project
* [HOCON](https://github.com/jclawson/jackson-dataformat-hocon): experimental, partial implementation to support [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) format -- work in progress

### JVM Language modules

* [Scala](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala) to handle native Scala types (including but not limited to Scala collection/map types, case classes)

### Other, stable

Other fully usable modules by FasterXML team include:

* [Afterburner](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-afterburner): speed up databinding by 30-40% with bytecode generation to replace use of Reflection
* [JAXB Annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-jaxb-annotations): allow use of `JAXB` annotations as an alternative (in addition to or instead of) standard Jackson annotations
* [JSON Schema generator](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-jsonSchema): Generate JSON Schema, based on Jackson POJO introspection, including annotations
* [Mr Bean](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-mrbean): "type materialization" -- let Mr Bean generate implementation classes on-the-fly (NO source code generation), to avoid monkey code
* [Paranamer](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-paranamer): tiny extension for automatically figuring out creator (constructor, factory method) parameter names, to avoid having to specify `@JsonProperty`.

### Other, experimental

And finally, there are other still experimental modules provided by FasterXML team

* [Guice](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-guice): extension that allows injection values from Guice injectors (and basic Guice annotations), instead of standard `@JacksonInject` (or in addition to)
    * note: as of 2.2.x, this is in proof-of-concept stage; should become stable for 2.3

## Documentation

### Web sites

* [jackson-docs](../../../jackson-docs) is our Github Jackson documentation hub
* [Jackson Wiki](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) contains older documentation (some 1.x specific; but mostly relevant for both 1.x and 2.x)
* [CowTalk](http://cowtowncoder.com/blog/blog.html) -- Blog with lots of Jackson-specific content
* [Jackson Users](http://jackson-users.ning.com) is a Jackson-specific discussion forum

### Paperwork

* Jackson [Contributor License Agreement](../../blob/master/contributor-agreement.pdf) (CLA) is a one-page document we need from every contributor of code (we will request it for pull requests)

### Older resources

These are obsolete resources, mostly useful for historical interest:
